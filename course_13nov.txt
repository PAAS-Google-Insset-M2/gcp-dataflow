BigQuery StudioExplorator ?

With one table ?
Use of data pipelines with Apache Beam

Create a pipeline => from bucket data to BigQuery table

Beam -> dataflow runner (main.py) & directrunner (main.py, bigquery.py, )
4 possible runners => 
apache flink runner, 
apache spark console (a lot of data !), 
(directrunner) => slowest (local execution),
DataflowRunner => executed on gcp
